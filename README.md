# biblioverlap_pipelines
Scripts with complete pipelines for document coverage analysis using biblioverlap

These scripts are meant to serve as a reference to biblioverlap users in how to implement complete pipelines for document coverage analysis from the ground up using the R console.

If you have a pipeline that analyzes documents from a bibliographic database (or set of databases) that hasn't been covered here, feel free to create a pull request.
